notes: 'Outemu SKY is a series of Cherry MX clone switches envisioned by Reddit user /u/hbheroinbob. He has stated that his goal was "to make a versatile factory made ergo-clear alternative with a reasonable street price; and have all of the parts be interchangeable with the cherry-class ecosystem".'

    text: 'The feel of the switches reminded me most of BOX Navy. A tiny, tiny amount of pre-travel, then some resistance, and then a sharp, strong BUMP that leads to nearly bottoming out. And that''s exactly what I wanted in a tactile switch, it felt just how I thought a tactile switch should feel.'

    text: 'In short â€“ despite my misgivings, I absolutely LOVE LOVE this switch. I prefer these to Durock Koalas, which I got in last week after paying express shipping from China, and those cost 3 times what I paid for the Skies.'
