  Also known as Water King V3. Most vendors don't stock the 37g version due to sticky stem/return issues (some switches in these batches have issues with the stem coming back up).

  **Note:** There has been much discussion on Reddit, Drop, Amazon listing etc. regarding these switches having a lower actuation force than advertised. While consistent with [Everglide's own website](https://everglide.co/products/everglide-aqua-king-water-king-switches-v3?variant=42887000326356) the force graphs show that the figures are bottom-out forces not actuation force. For example the 55g variant appears to be [independently checked](https://github.com/bluepylons/Open-Switch-Curve-Meter/blob/main/Force%20curve%20measurements/Everglide-Aqua-King-55g.png) and shows an actuation point around 40-45gf.

lubrication_notes: 'These are very well lubed from the factory but some people have found the odd switch in a batch to be overlubed with return issues - especially the 37g variant.'
