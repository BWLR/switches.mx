volume: normal

  From CannonKeys: "These are full nylon housing linear switches produced by Durock. The top housing has Durock branding. Durock has made new molds for this, and told us that the top and bottom housing are both made fully of Nylon, and that the stem is POM."

  Matching [lavender stabilizers](https://cannonkeys.com/collections/featured/products/lavender-stabilizers) are also available.

  Comparable in feel to Alpaca V2's and Gazzew's line of linear switches.

    source: 'https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/lavender-switch-review'
    text: 'They’re fairly smooth, have a pretty great sounding bottoming and topping out as a translucent nylon switch, and are near perfect on the metric of stem wobble. To add onto that as well, I’ve really fallen in love with the look of these switches and genuinely am tempted to go about using them in a build.'

    text: 'Pretty impressed. Fully lubed and filmed they sound very nice. Much less wobble than a gateron KS-8 and deeper sounding than typical JWK polycarbonate switches. Can’t quite get rid of all of swishy/scratchy sound of the legs on the contact leaf, but it’s very faint. I think I’m going to be using them soon in a build.'
