film: 'yes'
notes: |-
  Alpacas are a re-colour of Durock's incredibly smooth linear based on the SA Bliss colorway by Minterly, designed by Prime Keyboards.

  A very popular and sought after switch, especially around mid-2020.

  Also available in silent version.

  "V1" and "V2" Alpacas do not exist. Alpacas will always be made with the latest iteration of mold design. "V2" releases are smoother than earlier versions.

    text: '<p>These Alpaca switches comes pre-lubed, so they&#8217;re already super smooth, as smooth as Tealios &#038; Inks. They sound amazing stock.  I think part of the reason is that the stem is a bit longer like the Halo &#038; Cream switches (not as long as them though).  This makes them a bit louder which I personally prefer. This combined with SA caps &#038; the acrylic case make them sound very nice and creamy.  I love these switches.  Highly recommended.</p>'

    text: 'Alpacas just feel so smooth out of the box, and they sound great as well. It''s sort of like typing on marshmelllows, with a great sound. Honestly, the best part is that you don''t really have to lube them since they already feel great when you get them. They pretty much opened my eyes to linears'
