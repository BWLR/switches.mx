  Also known as Durock Piano Switches. The Durock POM switch uses a proprietary POM blend for the top and bottom housing with a redesigned stem composed of a mystery material that was recently confirmed to be P3, providing a deeper sound signature while still giving you that smooth JWK feel.

  Unlike other POM housing switches they do not benefit from or require a break-in period like NovelKeys Creams.

    text: 'An excellent alternative to the popular ‘Cream’ switches. The Durock POM switches take the knowledge of what made previous Durock linear switches so popular and offers them in a newly designed POM housing. POM is a low friction plastic that feels almost ‘soapy’ to the touch, this makes it an excellent material for the creation of smooth switches. Typically POM is also found in the stems of mechanical switches but in this case Durock has opted to use a proprietary materials in order to avoid an issue known as “stick slip” which affects other POM housing switches.'
