    description: '"For a smooth linear feel with solid reliability, ACE’s TTC linear switches are a smart choice. With springs made from gold-plated stainless steel and contacts made from gold alloy, they’re both durable and responsive. They require 60 grams of force for actuation, putting them in the midrange for linear switch sensitivity. Each switch also has a substantial 2 millimeters of pretravel, so softer mishits won’t likely register. Completing each switch, a lime green stem and mint green base housing add natural flair to accent any board." - [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/ace-ttc-linear-switches#overview)'

    text: '<p>I found these switches to have a very smooth feeling in stock form. They sounded very deep, but hearing other soundtests, make me come to the conclusion that it varies greatly depending on the keyboard.</p>'
