      The Pro Purples definitely do bring a certain level of nuance to the mid-to-light tactility range of
      switches that doesn’t seem to be all that popular among modern makers, today. Much like with
      the Pro Burgundy switches, I genuinely think this alone shows that they deserve more praise.

      These are completely different from the Speed switches in terms of their stems.
      The purple feels really nice. The bump is decently strong and smooth. It feels comparable to a Zealio V1 65g.

    text: 'Pro Purples offer medium spring resistance and Kailh’s take on an ergonomic tactile response. They’re a potential upgrade path for people who like MX Browns, especially in mixed use scenarios. The Pros are more responsive in games and offer better bottom out performance for daily typists.'

    text: 'If you are a die-hard gamer or even a typist who is expected to type in quite consistently, the Kailh Pro Purple should be a great choice for practically each of your choices. If you want to get the best of both worlds with high-end durability, a slightly audible bump and smoothness of a linear key switch – and all those features in a  single keyboard, the Kailh Pro Purple should definitely be what you would find one of the exciting choices for every one of your requirements.'
