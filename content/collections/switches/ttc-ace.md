    description: '"For a smooth linear feel with solid reliability, ACE’s TTC linear switches are a smart choice. With springs made from gold-plated stainless steel and contacts made from gold alloy, they’re both durable and responsive. They require 60 grams of force for actuation, putting them in the midrange for linear switch sensitivity. Each switch also has a substantial 2 millimeters of pretravel, so softer mishits won’t likely register. Completing each switch, a lime green stem and mint green base housing add natural flair to accent any board." - [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/ace-ttc-linear-switches#overview)'

      This switch is one of the most popular linear switches recently in the Chinese community, most of the reviews are very good. I think the reason people are not interested in it is the lack of marketing overseas from TTC. They normally manufacture switches for mass production keyboards, but since last year they have had several good switches for the custom community, such as TTC gold pink, so far I can only find them on the KBDfans website.

      The person who designed this switch is also a reviewer and keyboard enthusiast who uploads videos on Chinese Youtube. It was a limited run in China and sold out pretty quickly.

      For the sound, most of the sound tests I heard are high pitch, and crispy. I would say it is very good for gaming and fast typing. Most importantly, it is one of the best factory-lubed switches in the market - that's the feedback from the Chinese community over the past two months. Because the designer wants it to be a ready-to-use switch for everyone.

  Underrate switch. Smooth, great sound from factory.

  Designed by Chinese reviewer and keyboard enthusiast Red Eye Monster (hence the "Reymo" badge on the side of the switch top housing).
