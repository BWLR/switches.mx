notes: '<p>These switches were originally released by C3Equalz as their &#8220;Macho Switches&#8221; in early 2020. They were re-introduced as TKC&#8217;s &#8220;Banana Split Switches&#8221; in September of 2020 in the US market, starting their &#8220;Snack Time Switch Line&#8221;. TKC&#8217;s 3PM drop was mildly successful, selling out in a few hours. The 9PM drop, however, was still in stock 12 hours later, at 9AM.</p>'
