  "LUBED
  Lubed Glorious Panda switches come with G-Lube expertly pre-applied to the upper housing, spring, and stem of each switch. Perfect for someone who is looking for fully optimized sound and performance right out of the box - no prep time or disassembly needed." - [Glorious](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches)


  (If you buy them unlubed)
  Use a light lube on the sliders to be safe. Lube like a normal tactile switch.

  "Unlubed Glorious Panda switches come out of the box completely dry so you can easily apply your choice of lubricant. Perfect for hands-on users who prefer a more customized switch performance to fit their unique style. We recommend checking out our line of switch modding tools for the most efficient DIY switch lubing experience possible." - [Glorious](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches)

  "A SWITCH LIKE NO OTHER.
  The Glorious Panda is no ordinary mechanical keyboard switch. Created from the original INVYR Panda housing molds with improved internals and upgraded materials, the GP unlocks a transcendent tactile typing experience unlike anything your fingers have ever enjoyed.

  Engineered with the most premium materials sourced from around the world, this switch features buttery-smooth operation, perfectly tactile response, and a sweet-sounding “thock” like a song from the heavens.

  The feeling of Glorious Pandas could be described as a very snappy and responsive tactile switch. They feature a strong 'bump' at the start of the downstroke with a quick snap back to position in the upstroke. You'll notice less pre-travel, smoother operation, and a quicker snap back than its "holy" cousin.
  Once you try it, your fingers won't be able to get enough.
  The Glorious Panda is made with uncompromised quality. Below is a full breakdown of each component.

  Top Shell - Created from original Invyr tooling, modified to incorporate Glorious branding, made with premium grade polycarbonate
  Stem - New and improved Glorious stem that provides less pretravel for the tactile bump to occur and a stronger upward stroke, composed of POM sourced from Japan
  Spring - 67 gram stainless steel spring with nickel plating, sourced from Korea
  Leaf - Premium grade copper, sourced from Japan
  Bottom Shell - Created from original INVYR tooling using premium Nylon PA66, 3-pin" - [Glorious](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches)
