    text: '<p>An interesting switch with a pleasant sound, and a really interesting stem that unfortunately seems to be incompatible with lighter springs. Might be a great tactile option for heavy-handed typists.</p>'

    text: '<p>These Blueberries have benefited from a one week break in period. Whether you plan to lube them or not they are ten times less scratchy in my opinion after some constant use for about a week. I believe its the pom housing slowly doing what it is intended to do.</p>'
