lubrication_notes: 'While Gateron CJ switches are just fine stock, they do benefit from being lubed, though any lube of choice is satisfactory. With most linear switches, we recommend Krytox 205g0 on the housing and stem, and GPL 105 or GPL 106 on the springs. Depending on the type of lube used, the acoustics will deepen slightly, so if you’re not a fan of the sound being quite as clacky, then going with a thicker lube may be the way to go!- [Ashkeebs](https://www.ashkeebs.com/product/gateron-cj-linear-switches/)'

      Gateron CJ switches, the newest switch from the manufacturer as of September 2021, are a great linear switch that have a smooth, satisying keypress and will certainly satisfy clacky linear lovers. While all-POM switches tend to run into issues of feeling leathery, Gateron’s proprietary Ink housing plastic is used effectively in the top housing to allow for a smooth actuation and to round out the clacky sound. With a 50g actuation and 60g bottom-out, you won’t need to worry about fatigue using these in a daily driver.
