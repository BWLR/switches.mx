    text: '<p>They are smooth, silent with a heavier tactile bump. They feel very similar to the T1 except that they are softer at bottoming out.</p><p>The bump feels smoother and rounder compared to the Zeal Zilent V2 67g. Also similar to (don&#8221;t kill me for that) my HHKB with Redux Light Domes.</p>'
