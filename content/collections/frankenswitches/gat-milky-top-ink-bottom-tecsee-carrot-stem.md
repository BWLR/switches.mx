title: 'Cthulu Switch'
description: 'The cthulu switch originally used a gateron milky top, a gateron ink bottom, and a cream stem. However, the Tecsee Carrots have overgrown the cream stems since the switch itself is cheaper, the pole is longer, and creams no longer fit. The ink bottom is the best part of the ink imo, and the milky top is the best part of the yellow imo. Throw in a long pole stem, boom. Cthulu.'
