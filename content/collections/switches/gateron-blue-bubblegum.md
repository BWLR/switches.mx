      From Keebhut, a small vendor out of Southern California comes itâ€™s first switch, the Gateron Blue Bubblegum Linear. 

      The colour scheme for this switch is inspired by the colour of bubblegum, combined with the the color of Blue Raspberry, hence the name, Blue Bubblegum. The materials were chosen to retain the smoothness and feel of the much loved Gateron Black Inks while using a nylon top to lower the pitch of the switch and with a 65g spring rather than the heavier 80g spring in the Black Inks.
