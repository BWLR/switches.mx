title: H1
volume: normal

film: 'yes'
film_notes: '<p>Film definitely helps to reduce the stem wobble on these switches.</p>'
notes: '<p>A great, smooth linear switch with a nice, &#8216;thocky&#8217; sound profile. Originally designed by HHHH as a modern switch with a similar feel to vintage Cherry MX Blacks.</p>'

    text: '<p>I really enjoy the sound signature of these switches. Just like other Durock/JWK switches, they&#8217;re extremely smooth right out of the gate. Lube just primarily changes the sound.</p>'

    text: '<p>Excellent switches out of the box. The sound is deeper than stock Tangerines with comparable smoothness. There is absolutely zero spring crunch or ping and, even though they are rated as 78g bottom out, they don&#8217;t feel as heavy as i would have expected. There is some stem wobble although not enough to bother me.</p>'

    text: '<p>Overall, I am quite happy with these switches in terms of their out-of-box feeling and their attempt at creating an alternative to the ‘Vint Black meme’.</p>'

    text: '<p>Overall, these switches are pretty great. I think at the price point they will be offered at, these are a steal. I do think that anyone planning on using these should get some switch films to mitigate the wobble issue, but other than that, these are some of the best switches I&#8217;ve ever used, and my favorite switches of the year so far.</p>'
