    text: 'HPX is definitely a bit more assertive on the tactility than the original. I have the U4T as well, and side by side, they have a similarly sized tactility. The bump on the U4T feels a tad sharper, while the HPX is a tad rounder. Those are just my non-scientific comparisons.'

      The HPX has a large yet soft tactile bump. As a comparison, it is less aggressive than something like the Anubis.

      In terms of sound, I found the handful I had to test to be more clacky (higher pitched) than thocky (deep), even when the stem rails were lightly lubed with 3204.

      The HPXs could be used without lubing, but I recommend some 105 on the springs to remove the spring ping.
