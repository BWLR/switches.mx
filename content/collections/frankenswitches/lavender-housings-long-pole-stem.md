title: 'Lavender Housings/Long Pole Stem'
description: 'These are called Ubecakes. They came from youtuber Magniboards, in his video: KFE CE unboxing... They were called Ubecakes because they reminded him of Ubecakes. It''s just a cream in lavender housings, but i''m not sure Cream stems work anymore. You''ll have to use other long pole stems, most notably Tecsee Carrots.'
