## Project structure

The website is built using [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) - the Laravel PHP CMS. I run this locally using [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead). The beauty of Statamic is that it's all self-contained with no external database; the content is all stored in yaml and markdown files in the `/content` directory.

To get it running inside a virtual machine you'll need to run `composer install` first.

To build local assets and then to run the watcher:
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch-poll`
- Open [homesteadswitchesmx.test](http://homesteadswitchesmx.test/)
